\begin_layout Problem
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 be a nonempty and finite set of alternatives.
 Consider the following bounded rational consumer.
 Given a menu 
\begin_inset Formula $A\subseteq X$
\end_inset

, the consumer searches sequentially through the menu according to a fixed
 search order on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 At each step in the search process, the consumer compares the utility of
 the item that she sees to a fixed threshold.
 If the utility of the item is above the threshold then the consumer stops
 the search and picks the item.
 Formally, let 
\begin_inset Formula $S\subseteq X\times X$
\end_inset

 be a linear order on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, let 
\begin_inset Formula $u:X\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 be a utility function, and 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{*}\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 be a threshold.
 The choice of this bounded rational consumer is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{BR}(A)=\{b\in A|u(b)\geq u^{*};\text{there exists no\quad}aSb;u(a)\geq u^{*}\}
\]

\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $A\subseteq X$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(a) Show that the choice correspondence 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{BR}$
\end_inset

 defined above is in fact a choice function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(b) Show that the choice correspondence 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{BR}$
\end_inset

 satisfies WARP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(c) Assume you observe a dataset 
\begin_inset Formula $(2^{X}\setminus\emptyset,c)$
\end_inset

 (such that 
\begin_inset Formula $c:2^{X}\setminus\emptyset\to2^{X}\setminus\emptyset$
\end_inset

 is an observed choice function -possibly different from 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{BR}$
\end_inset

-) that satisfies WARP.
 Show that there is a bounded rational consumer characterized by a triple
 
\begin_inset Formula $(S,u,u^{*})$
\end_inset

 a linear order on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, a utility function and a thresholds as in (a) such that 
\begin_inset Formula $c(A)=c_{BR}(A)$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in2^{X}\setminus\emptyset$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
d) Assume now that there is a distribution over search orders, denote the
 collection of all search orders/linear orders on 
\begin_inset Formula $X\times X$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 The distribution over search orders is 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi\in\Delta(\mathcal{S})$

\begin_layout Problem
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 be a nonempty and finite set of alternatives.
 Consider the following stochastic bounded rational consumer called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stochastic limited consideration (SLC)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Assume there is a default alternative 
\begin_inset Formula $o\notin X$
\end_inset

, that is always present in any given menu.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{*}=X\cup\{o\}$
\end_inset

.
 Also let the collection of menus that contain 
\begin_inset Formula $o$
\end_inset

 be defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $A\subseteq X^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $o\in A$
\end_inset

.
 Given a menu 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

, the probability of this consumer of choosing an alternative 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 in menu 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{A}(a)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{A}\in\Delta(A)$
\end_inset

, is given by the following decision algorithm.
 First the consumer is endowed with a strict preference relation 
\begin_inset Formula $\succ$
\end_inset

 defined over 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{*}$
\end_inset

 with the restriction that for any 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in X$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $x\succ o$
\end_inset

 (i.e., the default is the worst item).
 The consumer is also endowed with a distribution over mental categories.
 Mental categories are all subsets of 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{*}$
\end_inset

, we call them 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}$
\end_inset

.
 At each decision trial the consumer draws a mental category from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}$
\end_inset

 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $m\in\Delta(\mathcal{D})$
\end_inset

 with the restriction that 
\begin_inset Formula $m(D)=0$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $o\notin D$
\end_inset

 (i.e., the probability of drawing a category that does not have the default
 is zero).
 Then the consumer forms a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

consideration set
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by taking the intersection of menu 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 such that the consideration set is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $D\cap A$
\end_inset

.
 Then the consumer maximizes her preferences 
\begin_inset Formula $\succ$
\end_inset

 on the consideration set 
\begin_inset Formula $D\cap A$
\end_inset

.
 The resulting probability of this decision algorithm is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho_{A}(a)=\sum_{D\in\mathcal{D}}m(D)1(a\succ b\forall b\in(D\cap A),b\neq a),
\]

\begin_layout Problem

\begin_inset Formula $1(\cdot)=1$
\end_inset

 when the argument is true and zero otherwise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A complete stochastic dataset, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, is a collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{A}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $p(b,A\cup\{a\})<p(b,A)$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}\succ a_{i+1}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,\cdots,n-1$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}\succ a_{1}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We say that a complete stochastic datasest, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

\begin_inset Formula $A,B\in\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $A\subseteq B$

 it must be that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{B}(a)\leq p_{A}(a)$

c) Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$

 be generated by a SLC such that 
\begin_inset Formula $m(X^{*})=1$

 (40 points) Modeling the

\end_inset

Endowment Effect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I am going to present to you a summary of an experiment showing a behavioral
 bias called the Endowment Effect.
 The task is to write a decision model algorithm to explain the Endowment
 Effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Endowment Effect Experiment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kahneman, Knetch and Thaler [1990], did an experiment with the following
 features:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
44 subjects 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
22 subjects given mugs 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The other 22 subjects given nothing 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Subjects who owned mugs asked to announce the price at which they would
 be prepared to sell mug 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Subjects who did not own mug announced price at which they are prepared
 to buy mug 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Experimenter figured out prices at which supply of mugs equals demand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If our subjects are rational consumers then the prediction in this market
 is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Prediction for rationality: As mugs are distributed randomly, we should
 expect half the mugs (11) to get traded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Explanation: Consider the group of mug lovers (i.e.
 those that have valuation above the median), of which there are 22.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Half of these should have mugs, and half should not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 11 mug haters that have mugs should trade with the 11 mug lovers that
 do not.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
Experiment Outcome 
\series default
however differs from the 
\series bold
Prediction
\series default
, and we call this the 
\series bold
Endowment Effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In 4 sessions, the number of trades was 4,1,2 and 2 (respectively per session).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Median seller valued mug at $5.25 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Median buyer valued mug at $2.75 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Willingness to pay/willingness to accept gap 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Subject's preferences seem to be affected by whether or not their reference
 point was owning the mug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Explain why the Endowment Effect is not consistent with a traditional model
 of rationality.
 Hint: The answer has less to do with the idea of revealed preferences,
 but more with the idea of stability of preferences.
 Write down the model of trade formally.
 You can assume a parametric distribution of preferences, make as simple
 as possible (uniform distribution).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Propose a decision algorithm that explains the endowment effect given the
 trading scheme of the experiment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Calibrate your model parameters to reproduce the experiment outcome.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Grading Criterion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Work group is not allowed, if I find out that several of you have essentially
 the same model, you will receive the total grade of this question divided
 by the number of students that share the same response.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Every question indicates how much points they are worth out of 100.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The last question will be graded on the following 5 items: Logical consistency
 of the decision algorithm.
 Clarity of the explanation of the decision algorithm.
 Degree of success in explaining the endowment effect.
 Clarity in the explanation of the endowment effect using the decision algorithm.
 Creativity and degree to which you have included topics that we covered
 in class (limited attention, reference dependence, among others).
