\begin_layout Abstract
This exam has three problems, the third one is modelling.
 You will be graded on the basis of your exam-structure over 90 points.
 Work group is not allowed, if I find out that several of you have essentially
 the same responses in any section, e.g., the same model, the same code, the
 same derivations, you will receive the total grade of this question divided
 by the number of students that share the same response.
 You can communicate and talk among you, I cannot prevent this anyway, but
 you have to write your own answers and you have to do your own derivations
 and your own code.
 If you share your code, answers explicitly and ideas for the model you
 are exposing yourself to have less than half the grade.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
We have

 countries, with typical elements 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j\in I$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
We assume that each country specializes in the production of only one good.
 The supply of each good is fixed (equivalently, each region is endowed
 with only positive quantity of one good, and there is no production).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
If 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is the consumption by country 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, consumers in region 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 maximize
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U(c)=\left(\sum_{i\in I}\beta_{i}^{(1-\sigma)/\sigma}c_{ij}^{(\sigma-1)/\sigma}\right)^{\sigma/(\sigma-1)},
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
subject to the budget constraint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{i}p_{ij}c_{ij}=y_{j}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
We have 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 as the elasticity of substitution between all goods, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a positive distribution parameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{j}$
\end_inset

 is a regional income of country 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 consumers, and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is the price of region 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 good for 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 consumers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ij}$
\end_inset

 differs per location 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 due to trade-costs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 denote the exporter's supply price, net of trade costs, and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{ij}\geq1$
\end_inset

 is the trade cost factor between 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j$
\end_inset

 (when 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{ij}=1$
\end_inset

 then there is free-trade).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{ij}=p_{i}t_{ij}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
We assume that trade costs are absorbed by the exporter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Formally, we assume that for each good shipped from 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 the exporter bears a costs equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{ij}-1$
\end_inset

 of country 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 goods.
 The exporter passes on these trade costs to the importer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
The nominal value of exports is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{ij}=p_{ij}c_{ij}.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Market clearing implies here that in nominal terms endowments are equal
 to aggregate demand:

\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}p_{i}=\frac{y_{i}^{1/(1-\sigma)}}{(\sum_{j\in I}(t_{ij}/P_{j})^{1-\sigma}y_{j})^{1/(1-\sigma)}}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Important: I need step-by-step derivation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
3) Let 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{W}=\sum_{j\in I}y_{j}$
\end_inset

 be the world income, and income share 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{j}=y_{j}/y^{W}$
\end_inset

.
 Show that, replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}p_{i}$
\end_inset

 on the nominal demand, we can obtain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{ij}=\frac{y_{i}y_{j}}{y^{W}}\left(\frac{t_{ij}}{\Pi_{i}P_{j}}\right)^{1-\sigma},
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
where 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
\begin_inset Formula

\Pi_{i}=\left(\sum_{j\in I}(t_{ij}/P_{j})^{1-\sigma}\theta_{j}\right)^{1/(1-\sigma)}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Important: I need step-by-step derivation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem

\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem

 In particular, show that the implicit solution to the price index 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{i}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in I$
\end_inset

 for a contraction mapping.
 You can assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{i}$
\end_inset

 take values in a closed set for simplicity.
 Also note that, that you have to rewrite the price index equation in the
 form.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{j}=g_{j}(P_{1},\cdots P_{I}).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
For the gravity model 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is continuously differentiable, so you can compute it's Jacobian.
 For the computing the norm of the Jacobian use whatever norm makes easier
 your computation.
 Euclidean or Max matrix norms are good candidates.
 I used the Euclidean matrix norm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Important: Only for this item, assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $I=\{1,2\}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{i}\geq1\forall i$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\frac{1}{2},t_{ij}=1,\theta_{i}=\frac{1}{2}.$
\end_inset

 Remember you have to show that the the norm of the Jacobian of the mapping
 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is less than 1, for all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
5) Show that, the gravity model implies that there are constants 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}\forall i\in I$
\end_inset

, and

\begin_layout Problem

\begin_inset Formula $X$

\begin_inset Formula $\succeq\subseteq X\times X$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Definition
Consider a triple of consumers, firms and endowments 
\begin_inset Formula $(\{X_{i},\succeq_{i}\}_{i=1}^{I},\{Y_{j}\}_{j=1}^{J},\omega)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}=X\subseteq\mathbb{R}_{+}^{L}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $L\geq2$

\begin_layout Definition
Prove that if an allocation

\begin_inset Formula $p=(p_{1},\cdots,p_{L})$

 constitute a price equilibrium with transfers, then the allocation 
\begin_inset Formula $(x^{*},y^{*})$
\end_inset

 is Pareto optimal.
 (Hint: Write down the definition of a price equilibrium with transfers
 using the (possibly incomplete) preorder 
\begin_inset Formula $\succeq_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that when preferences are incomplete you have to modify the notion
 of preference maximization.)

 and on 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{j}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $j\in\{1,\cdots,J\}$
\end_inset

 would suffice to guarantee that every Pareto efficient allocation

\begin_layout Problem
(Modeling) Modeling the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

(Dynamic) Endowment Effect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I am going summarize an in class experiment that took place on December
 2020 regarding Top Trading Cycles (TTC) activity, that exhibits a behavioral
 bias called the Endowment Effect with dynamic traits.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
The task is to write a decision model algorithm to explain the stylized
 facts our our TTC activity: namely, the number of trades realized with
 respect to total trades is smaller in the treatment group than in the control.
 More important, the expected value of trade in the treatment group is smaller
 than in the control group.
 I remind you that the treatment group was involved in a dynamic implementation
 of the TTC algorithm, participating in two rounds of trade.
 The control group instead stated their preferences as a ranking of all
 exams, and the TTC algorithm was implemented using that information and
 the randomly drawn endowments to obtain their assignments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Due to randomization, under the rationality hypothesis of behavior, both
 the treatment and control group should have the same expected value of
 trade, and the same probability of trade.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
Since the results of our randomization reject the rationality hypothesis,
 you have to come up with a model that explains the two stylized facts that
 we have described.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The TTC randomization.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
15 subjects 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
10 subjects were randomly assigned to treatment, and 5 to control.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A set of 15 exam-structures where randomly assigned as initial endowments
 to the 15 students.
 Exam structures differ in the points assigned to 3 different parts of the
 exam.
 The students faced a similar structure in the midterm exam, but otherwise
 did not had access to the final exam.
 An exam structure is a positive vector 
\begin_inset Formula $(a_{s},b_{s},c_{s})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{s}+b_{s}+c_{S}=100$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{s}$
\end_inset

 gives the percentage points assigned to question 1 for student 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{s}$
\end_inset

 the percentage points assigned to question 2 for student 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{s}$
\end_inset

 the percentage points assigned to question 3 for student 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
 Each exam structure assigned to student 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 then gives a different weight to each of the three question.
 Since students may have heterogeneous skills and preferences that affect
 which exam structure they like.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The treatment subjects, had to do live/dynamic trade using a Qualtrics survey.
 They submitted their most preferred alternative and they knew their endowment.
 Trade can only happen inside their group.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The control subjects, had to to submit a complete ranking of all exams in
 their group.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Trade happen live for the treatment group, with the first round taking 7
 hours, and the second round taking 12 hours (with 3 waking hours).
 There was no need for more rounds.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The preferences of the control group students was used in a TTC algorithm
 given their endowments to produce the new assignments.
 The algorithm terminated in two rounds.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The assignments were announced publicly to all 15 students, and they were
 asked to fill a post-match survey.
 The treatment group had to submit all their ranked preferences with the
 clear understanding that it would be used only for analysis purposes.
 Both the treatment and control submitted their subjective and expected
 gains from trades as percentage points.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If our subjects are rational consumers then the prediction in this market
 is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Prediction for rationality: As exam-structures are distributed randomly,
 and the treatment and control membership was uniformly chosen, we should
 expect that the probability of trade in both the treatment and control
 is the same.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As exam-structures are distributed randomly, and the treatment and control
 membership was uniformly chosen, we expect that the subjective expected
 gains from trade are the same among treatment and control.

Grading Criterion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Work group is not allowed, if I find out that several of you have essentially
 the same model, you will receive the total grade of this question divided
 by the number of students that share the same response.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The model will be graded on the following 5 items: Logical consistency of
 the decision algorithm.
 Clarity of the explanation of the decision algorithm.
 Degree of success in explaining the endowment effect qualitatively.
 Calibration to the actual numbers of the experiment.
 Creativity and degree to which you have included topics that we covered
 in class (limited attention, reference dependence, among others).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: write down the TTC algorithm using utilities instead of rankings,
 since you have to explain the gap in gains from trade.
